 # Welcome to My Blog

Please allow me to welcome you to my personal site/blog called __SleepBag's Bizzare Adventures__, a site that I use to document my interests and findings that I come across while surfing the internet. It also acts as a simple blog that I also use to document my reflections and realisations.


## Who Am I

- My name is Krishna and I am a high school student who lives in India and I love to express myself which is one of the main reasons that I have made this blog
- I have a great interest in the study of History and Political Science, including a pinch of International Affairs in the mix to make it more interesting.
- I am also very interested in Linux and other free and open-source programmes. These FOSS technologies are also one of the main focusses of by blog including the above mentioned topics
